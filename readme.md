First of all, ensure you have python3 installed in your machine as this app code is based on python3 specifications

## Usage 


```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudstrife9494/falcon_boilerplate
$ cd falcon_boilerplate
$ pipenv shell # to switch to the project virtual environment using pipenv tool and creating a Pipfile with required dependencies versions 
$ pipenv install # installing all external dependencies locally

## Note 

If your dev environment is not pointing at a python3 executable by default, you can switch to python3 using:
```bash
